# Programming Learning Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of examples and practice materials for learning programming across multiple domains: Java, SQL, and Frontend Web Development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It's structured as a progressive learning path for each technology.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections:

```
/
├── 1.java/            # Java programming examples
├── 2.sql/             # SQL examples and documentation
└── 3.frontend/        # Frontend web development
    ├── html/          # HTML examples
    ├── css/           # CSS examples
    └── js/            # JavaScript examples
```

## 1. Java Programming

The Java section covers fundamental to advanced concepts, organized in a progressive learning order:

```
1.java/
├── 01.basics/           # Java basics and fundamentals
├── 02.operators/        # Operators in Java
├── 03.loops/            # Loop structures
├── 04.arrays/           # Arrays and data structures
├── 05.static/           # Static members and methods
├── 06.strings/          # String manipulation
├── 07.inheritance/      # Object inheritance
├── 08.access_modifiers/ # Access modifiers and encapsulation
├── 09.abstract/         # Abstract classes
├── 10.interfaces/       # Interfaces implementation
├── 11.this-super/       # 'this' and 'super' keywords
├── 12.constructors/     # Constructor creation and usage
├── 13.method-overloading/ # Method overloading techniques
├── 14.exceptions/       # Exception handling
├── 15.java-io/          # Input/Output operations
└── 16.collections/      # Java collections framework
```

Each directory contains practical examples demonstrating the specific concept, with clear comments and annotations for learning purposes.

## 2. SQL

The SQL section includes comprehensive examples of SQL queries and database operations:

```
2.sql/
└── sql.docx            # SQL documentation and examples
```

This document covers various SQL operations, including:
- Basic queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Advanced JOIN operations
- Data aggregation
- Stored procedures and functions
- Database design principles

## 3. Frontend Web Development

The frontend section is divided into three key web technologies:

### HTML

```
3.frontend/html/
├── basics/            # HTML fundamentals
├── forms/             # Form creation and usage
└── semantic/          # Semantic HTML5 elements
```

### CSS

```
3.frontend/css/
├── basics/            # CSS fundamentals
├── compatibility/     # Cross-browser compatibility
├── effects/           # Visual effects and animations
└── page_adjustments/  # Layout and responsive design
```

### JavaScript

```
3.frontend/js/
├── access/            # Property access and object manipulation
├── basics/            # JavaScript fundamentals
└── events/            # Event handling and user interaction
```

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Learning Path**: The numbered directories suggest a recommended learning sequence.
2. **Examples**: Each concept includes practical examples that you can run and modify.
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Topics build on each other, introducing new concepts incrementally.

## Running the Examples

### Java Examples
- Requires Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Compile with: `javac FileName.java`
- Run with: `java FileName`

### Web Development Examples
- Open HTML files in any modern web browser
- JavaScript examples can be viewed using the included JS file viewer in `3.frontend/js/basics/view_js.html`
